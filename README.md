## Usage

```
git clone git@github.com:arghadeep25/Kalman-Filter.git
cd Kalman-Filter
```


#### Build Script (Recommended)
Build Helper
```
Usage: ./build.sh -b CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE -e BUILD_EXAMPLE
	-b CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: Release | Debug
	-e BUILD_EXAMPLE: ON | OFF
```
```
./build.sh -b Release -e ON
```


#### Build Manually
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_EXAMPLE=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j4
```

Turning ON and OFF the examples might need to remove the build folder manually.
